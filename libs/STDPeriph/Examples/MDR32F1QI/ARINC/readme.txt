@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the ARINC.
The ARINC transmitter send the data array and the ARINC receiver take the data
in the interrupt on presence of of data in the FIFO.
The received frame is checked and LED1 light up to indicate what the 
communication was successful, else LED2 light up.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F1QI eval board with
      MDR32F1QI microcontroller.
    - Pin PB0 must be connected to pin PD13.
    - Pin PB1 must be connected to pin PD14.
    - VD6 jamper must be enable.
    - VD7 jamper must be enable.
    - HSE oscillator is used so it should be present.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_eeprom.c
        MDR32FxQI_utils.c
        MDR32FxQI_bkp.c
        MDR32FxQI_arinc429r.c
        MDR32FxQI_arinc429t.c
        MDR32FxQI_uart.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
