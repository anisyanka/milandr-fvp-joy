@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN in loopback mode.
The CAN cell performs a transmission of a Remote Transmit Request at 500 Kbits/s. 
Reception remote frame is done in the interrupt handler. 
The received frame is checked and LED1 light up to indicate what the 
communication was successful, else LED2 light up.
If CONFIG_CAN_PINS defined, PC9 and PC10 pins are configured as CAN1 RX and TX.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                          Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F1QI eval board with MDR32F1QI microcontroller.
    - HSE oscillator is used so it should be present.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_can.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
