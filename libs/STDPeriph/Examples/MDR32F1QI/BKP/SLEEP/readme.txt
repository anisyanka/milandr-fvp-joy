@par Example Description

This example shows how to use MCU SLEEP mode.
Program includes the following steps:
    - Configure PE9 as SELECT button;
    - Configure PD9 as non-sleeping state LED indicator, PD8 as SLEEP mode LED indicator,
      PD10 as wake switch indicator;
    - Initialize TIMER1 to generate interrupts to wake MCU;
    - Monitor SELECT button to enable TIMER1, enable SPEEP mode LED and enter SLEEP mode;
    - Periodicaly switch non-sleeping state LED indicator.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c                      Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F1QI eval board with MDR32F1QI microcontroller.
    - SELECT button is connected to PE9.
    - VD7 led is connected to PD.8 pin, VD8 led ti PD.9, VD9 led ti PD.10.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_timer.c
        MDR32FxQI_dma.c
        MDR32FxQI_bkp.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
