@par Example Description

This example shows, how to use Timer block in PWM mode.
In this demo there are Timer initialization function and Led_Set function to set CCR value for each channel. 
User can watch channels output with rgb channels of HL1 LED installed on demo board.

@par Directory contains:

  - main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VK01 demo board with MDR1986VK01 
  microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR1986VK01_port.h
        MDR1986VK01_timer.h
        MDR1986VK01_clk.h
        demoboard.h
        leds.h
        
  - Edit the MDR1986VK01_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
