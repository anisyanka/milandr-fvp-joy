@par Example Description

This example shows, how to use encoder.
In this demo there are encoder pins and control initialisation and get encoder count function. 
On demo board user can control the result with B1 and watch it as tmp in debug mode.

@par Directory contains:

  - main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VK01 demo board with MDR1986VK01 
  microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR1986VK01_port.h
        MDR1986VK01_clk.h
        demoboard.h
        encoder.h
        
  - Edit the MDR1986VK01_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
