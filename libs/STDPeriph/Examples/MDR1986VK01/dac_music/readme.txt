@par Example Description

This example shows, how to use DAC in conjunction with an amplifier and headphones.
In this demo there are DAC initialisation function and DAC loop function which outputs music data to the buffer. Also, the amplifier is configured via I2C
Use headphones to test the example

@par Directory contains:

  - main.c              Main program

@par Hardware and Software environment:

  - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VK01 demo board with MDR1986VK01 
  microcontroller.

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
  - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
  - Add main.c file.
  - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR1986VK01_port.h
        MDR1986VK01_clk.h
        demoboard.h
        dac.h
        adc.h
        i2c.h
	i2c_eeprom.h
  - Edit the MDR1986VK01_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
  - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
  - Run the example.
