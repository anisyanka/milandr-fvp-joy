@par Example Description

This example shows how to use EEPROM:
    - Erase main and information memory banks
    - Blank check main and information memory banks
    - Word program and verification main memory bank
    - Word program and verification information memory bank
    - Erase main memory bank only
    - Blank check main memory bank
    - Verification information memory bank
    - Word program and verification main memory bank
    - Erase main and information memory banks
    - Blank check main and information memory banks


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c              Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR32F9Q2I eval board with MDR32F9Q2I microcontroller.
    - VD3 (LED0), VD4 (LED1) are connected to PC.0, PC.1 pins, respectively.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Library" folder:
        MDR32FxQI_config.h
        MDR32FxQI_port.c
        MDR32FxQI_rst_clk.c
        MDR32FxQI_eeprom.c
        MDR32FxQI_utils.c
    - Edit the MDR32FxQI_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - To allocate all code in RAM edit appropriate linker options.
      Place EEPROM functions in RAM by defining section "EXECUTABLE_MEMORY_SECTION" as RAM section.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
